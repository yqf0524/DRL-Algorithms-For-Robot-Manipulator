# Training-robot-manipulator-with-DRL
Project of my master thesis

The robot manipulator that was used in this thesis is KUKA LBR iiwa 14 R820

In order to improve the repeatability of robot manipulator, some algorithms such as TD3, SAC for sigle Agent RL and MAAC, MADDP for Multiagent were used.

Training envoronment and dynamic model of iiwa were created.
